The provided code defines a grid world problem and implements an Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) algorithm called Policy Iteration to find an optimal policy for the given problem. The grid world is represented by a matrix with specified rewards and obstacles. The ADP algorithm, implemented in the ADPLearner class, updates policies based on state-action pairs and their outcomes, iteratively refining the policy through policy evaluation and improvement steps. The PolicyIteration class is responsible for training the ADPLearner using the Policy Iteration algorithm. The G_W class represents the grid world problem and provides functions for generating transition matrices, calculating rewards, and simulating episodes. The code concludes with an example instantiation of the grid world problem, a predefined policy, and the Policy Iteration solver to demonstrate the algorithm's application on the given environment. Additionally, there are visualization functions to plot the grid world map and display policies and values.
